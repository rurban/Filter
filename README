DESCRIPTION
-----------
 
This distribution consists of a number of Source Filters.

For more details see the pod documentation embedded in the .pm files.

PREREQUISITES
-------------
 
Before you can build the Source Filters you need to have the following
installed on your system:

    * Perl 5.002 or better

If your Perl is less than version 5.004_55, the "order" test harness
will be skipped.


BUILDING THE MODULES
--------------------
 
Assuming you have met all the prerequisites, building the modules
should be relatively straightforward.

The modules can now be built using this sequence of commands:
 
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
 
The filters have been successfully built and tested on the following
systems (at least):

	SunOS 4.1.3 (Sun C compiler & gcc 2.7.2.3)
	Solaris 2.3 (Sun C Compiler)
	irix 5.3	
	irix 6.x	
	Windows NT 4.0 (Visual C++ 5.0 and Borland C++ 5.02)

GNU tr and GNU cpp must be installed somewhere on the path for the
testsuite to pass successfully on Windows NT.

INSTALLATION
------------
 
    make install
